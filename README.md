##HACK_THE_VALLEY_4##

Problem:

This application is all about the problem that every face while going on an appointment to meet an advisor or the professor,when you have to stand in the line.So the problem is time wasting. People specifically students have to waste a lot of time while waiting for their turn and this is not what we want for the students.Time is money. 

Solution:

Me With my team members Chris ,Jason, Abdullah and Frank , we are going to implement the Queue management system for the people who do not want to waste their time and save their precious time so they can be more productive.

STEPS:
-Turn on the application
-Main page with the office hours and advisors name will pop up
-Select the advisor
-The whole queue of the selected professor will pop up as a next page where 
-You can see the waiting estimated time
-Total number of Students that are already in line
-With the option to get in line if user want to
-Then if user click on the button to get in line 
-User will be added in the queue for that particular advisor
-Then he will be sent a notification before 10 minutes in advance 
-Just in case if the user could not make it there will be an option to opt out 
-This is pretty much the summary of our application Later on we can add more functionalities as we move forward
-Due to lack of resources and time constraint we were not able to finish a lot of stuff but we are gonna implement further feature    because this application is scalable and can be use anywhere where there is a need of queue management ,e.g Hospitals, Schools, walk in clinics etc
-And we can add features according to the requirement
